# SAGE
# Sustainable Aging Governance Engine (S.A.G.E.)

S.A.G.E. is a decision intelligence tool that helps policymakers, researchers, and local governments prioritize eldercare investments using open data and interactive simulation. It combines federal social vulnerability data with region-specific aging demographics and infrastructure estimates to identify high-need areas and recommend funding strategies.

# Project Overview

As aging populations grow and resources remain constrained, it’s increasingly important to understand where interventions can make the greatest impact. S.A.G.E. identifies these high-priority areas by calculating a custom **Elder Vulnerability Index** and simulating projected improvements in satisfaction based on funding levels and infrastructure quality.

This tool was built to support ethical, data-informed decisions in public health, aging services, and local planning.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Integrates U.S. county-level **CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)** data
- Merges with demographic data (% of population over 65)
- Computes **Elder Vulnerability Index**: a measure of aging-related risk
- Allows users to simulate changes in elder satisfaction based on proposed funding increases
- Displays regional comparisons and prioritization tiers in an interactive dashboard
